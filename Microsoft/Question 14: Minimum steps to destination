Problem Name: Minimum steps to destination 
Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-reach-a-given-number5234/1/

Question
Given an infinite number line. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in the ith move, you must take i steps. Given a 
destination D , find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.


Time Complexity: O(D), where D is the destination 
Space Complexity: O(1)


Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution{
public:
    int minSteps(int D){
        int steps = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while(sum<D) {
            sum+=steps;
            steps++;
        }
        while((sum-D)%2) {
            sum+=steps;
            steps++;
        }
        return steps-1;
    }
};

int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int D;
        cin>>D;
        
        Solution ob;
        cout<<ob.minSteps(D)<<"\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
