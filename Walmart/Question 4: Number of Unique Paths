Problem Name: Number of Unique Paths 
Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-unique-paths5339/1/

Question
Given a A X B matrix with your initial position at the top-left cell, find the number of possible unique paths to reach the bottom-right cell of the matrix from the 
initial position.
Note: Possible moves can be either down or right at any point in time, i.e., we can move to matrix[i+1][j] or matrix[i][j+1] from matrix[i][j].


Time Complexity: O(min(A, B)), where A and B is the number of rows and columns in the matrix
Space Complexity: O(1)


Solution
class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerOfGame(string colors) {
        
        int count1 = 0;
        int count2 = 0;
        
        int n = colors.length();
        for(int i=1; i<n-1; i++){
            if(colors[i-1] == colors[i]  &&  colors[i] == colors[i+1]){
                if(colors[i] == 'A'){
                    count1++;
                }
                else{
                    count2++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if(count1 <= count2){
            return false;
        }
        else{
            return true;
        }
    }
};
