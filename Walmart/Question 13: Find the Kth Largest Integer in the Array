Problem Name: Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array/

Question
You are given an array of strings nums and an integer k. Each string in nums represents an integer without leading zeros.
Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums.
Note: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if nums is ["1","2","2"], "2" is the first largest integer, "2" is the second-largest integer, 
and "1" is the third-largest integer.

 
Time Complexity: O(N * log(N)), where N is the length of the array
Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the array


Solution
class Solution {
public:
    
    static bool sorting_manually(string &s1, string &s2){
        if(s1.length() == s2.length()){
            return s1 < s2;
        }
        else{
            return s1.length() < s2.length();
        }
    }
    
    string kthLargestNumber(vector<string>& nums, int k) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<string> v = nums;
        
        sort(v.begin(), v.end(), sorting_manually);
        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            cout<<v[i]<<" ";
        }
        
        return v[n-k];
    }
};
