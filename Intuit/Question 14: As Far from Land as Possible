Problem Name: As Far from Land as Possible
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/

Question
Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell 
is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.
The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.


Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns
Space Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns


Solution

        int x[] = {-1,0,1,0};    
        int y[] = {0,1,0,-1};
        
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        
        // step 1 : pushing all coordinates of land
        for(int i=0 ; i<n ; i++)
            for(int j=0 ; j<m ; j++)
                if(grid[i][j] == 1)
                    q.push({i,j});
    
        // if matrix has no water then ans = -1 so return 
        if(q.size() == n*m)
            return -1;
        
        int dist = 0;

                for(int i=0 ; i<4; i++){
                    int newi = si + x[i];
                    int newj = sj + y[i];
                    if(newi>=0 and newi<n and newj>=0 and newj<m and grid[newi][newj] == 0)
                        q.push({newi,newj}) , grid[newi][newj] = 1;
