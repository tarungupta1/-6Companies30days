Problem Name: Number of Provinces
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

Question
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then 
city a is connected indirectly with city c.
A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise, Return 
the total number of provinces.


Time Complexity: O(log(E)), where E is the number of edges
Space Complexity: O(V), where V is the number of nodes


Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
        if (M.empty()) return 0;
        int n = M.size();

        vector<int> leads(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { leads[i] = i; }   // initialize leads for every kid as themselves

        int groups = n;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {   // avoid recalculate M[i][j], M[j][i]
                if (M[i][j]) {
                    int lead1 = find(i, leads);
                    int lead2 = find(j, leads);
                    if (lead1 != lead2) {       // if 2 group belongs 2 different leads, merge 2 group to 1
                        leads[lead1] = lead2;
                        groups--;
                    }
                }
