Problem Name: Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/

Question
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.
The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may 
not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.


Time Complexity: O(N * log(N)), where N is the number of elements in vector
Space Complexity: O(1)


Solution
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int D) {
        int n=weights.length;
        int sum=0,max=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum=sum+weights[i];
            
            max=Math.max(max,weights[i]);
            
        }
        
        int low=max;
        int high=sum;
        int ans=sum;    //for worst case when D=1   (also we need something for initialisation)
        while(low<=high){
            int mid=low+((high-low)/2);
            
            int cwt=0;
            int reqd=1;
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(cwt+weights[i]>mid){
                    reqd++;
                    cwt=0;
                }
                cwt+=weights[i];
            }
            
            if(reqd>D){
                low=mid+1;
            }
            else{   //reqd<=D
                ans=mid;
                high=mid-1;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
