Problem Name: Overlapping rectangles 
Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-rectangles1924/1/

Question
Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top 
corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle. Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. (L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle 
and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).
Note: It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.


Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)


Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    int doOverlap(int L1[], int R1[], int L2[], int R2[]) {
        // code here

        // whether first rectangle is above the other
        if(L1[1] < R2[1]  ||  L2[1] < R1[1]){
            return 0;
        }

        // whether first rectangle is towards the left of the other
        if(R1[0] < L2[0]  ||  R2[0] < L1[0]){
            return 0;
        }
        
        return 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int p[2], q[2], r[2], s[2];
        cin >> p[0] >> p[1] >> q[0] >> q[1] >> r[0] >> r[1] >> s[0] >> s[1];
        Solution ob;
        int ans = ob.doOverlap(p, q, r, s);
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
}
