Problem Name: Distributing M items in a circle of size N starting from K-th position
Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-rectangles1924/1/

Question
M items are to be delivered in a circle of size N. Find the position where the M-th item will be delivered if we start from a given position K. Note that items 
are distributed at adjacent positions starting from K.


Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

 // } Driver Code Ends


class Solution {
  public:
    int findPosition(int N , int M , int K) {
        // code here
        
        // number of toys left if we have distributed toys to everyone equally
        int r = M % N;
        
        // position where the damaged toy will be present, which we will be found out by adding number of toys left and starting position
        int position = (K + r - 1) % N;
        
        // as it is 1-based indexing so we have to check the position
        // if position is 0 then it means the toy is with the last child
        if(position == 0){
            return N;
        }
        else{
            return position;
        }
    }
};

// { Driver Code Starts.
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int N,M,K;
        
        cin>>N>>M>>K;

        Solution ob;
        cout << ob.findPosition(N,M,K) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}  // } Driver Code Ends
