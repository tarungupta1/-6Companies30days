Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/amend-the-sentence3235/1

Question
Given a string which is basically a sentence without spaces between words. However the first letter of every word is in uppercase. You need to print this sentence 
after following amendments:
  (i) Put a single space between these words
  (ii) Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.
Note: The first character of the string can be both uppercase/lowercase.


Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in vector
Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in vector


Solution
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution{
    public:
    string amendSentence (string s)    {
        // your code here
        string res = "", temp = "";
        res+=tolower(s[0]);
        for(int i=1; i<s.size(); i++){
            if(isupper(s[i])){
                res+=temp;
                res+=' ';
                temp = "";
                char ch = tolower(s[i]);
                temp+=ch;
            }
            else{
                temp+=s[i];
            }
        }
        res+=temp;
        return res;
    }
};

int main(){
	int t; cin >> t;
	while (t--)	{
		string s; cin >> s;
		Solution ob;
		cout << ob.amendSentence (s) << endl;
	}
}
