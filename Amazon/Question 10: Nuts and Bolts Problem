Problem Name: Nuts and Bolts Problem

Question
Given a set of N nuts of different sizes and N bolts of different sizes. There is a one-one mapping between nuts and bolts. Match nuts and bolts efficiently.
Comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with nut to see 
which one is bigger/smaller.
The elements should follow the following order ! # $ % & * @ ^ ~ .


Time Complexity: O(N * log(N)), where N is the number of nuts/ bolts
Space Complexity: O(1)


Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution{
public:	

	void matchPairs(char nuts[], char bolts[], int n) {
	    // code here
	    sort(nuts,nuts+n);
	    sort(bolts,bolts+n);
	}

};

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        char nuts[n], bolts[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> nuts[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> bolts[i];
        }
        Solution ob;
        ob.matchPairs(nuts, bolts, n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cout << nuts[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cout << bolts[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
