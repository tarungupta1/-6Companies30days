Question
Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.
Excel columns has a pattern like A, B, C, … ,Z, AA, AB, AC,…. ,AZ, BA, BB, … ZZ, AAA, AAB ….. etc. In other words, column 1 is named as “A”, column 2 as “B”, 
column 27 as “AA” and so on.


Time Complexity: O(log(N)), where N is the integer in the excel
Space Complexity: O(1)


Solution
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    string colName (long long int n) {
        string s = "";
        while(n != 0) {
            // To make the number 0 indexed
            n--;
            int r = n % 26;
            s = string(1, r + 'A') + s;
            n = n / 26;
        }
        return s;
    }
};

int main(){
    int t; cin >> t;
    while (t--)
	{
		long long int n; cin >> n;
		Solution ob;
		cout << ob.colName (n) << '\n';
	}
}
